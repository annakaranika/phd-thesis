# Changelog

**Breaking changes** will be highlighted in each version, if there are any.
Breaking change would mean a change is needed in the `.tex` file to accommodate the changes in the document class.

## v1.6 - 2026-04-02

### Breaking Changes

- The optional Copyright page and the Title page are now counted for page numbers.
  If you're referring to specific page numbers in your document, you may need to
  update those references.

### Other Changes

- Added support for chapter-level references. Use `\sectionwithreferences` to
  create a section that has its own References subsection at the end.
  You may need to add `defernumbers=true` to your `biblatex` options.

## v1.5 - 2026-03-24

Added the `\dedication` environment for better handling of the dedication section.
To update an existing document to include a dedication, add the following
after your `\acknowledgements` if using that, or otherwise after the `\abstract` section:

```latex
% dedication uses begin and end syntax because it opens a center environment
% which needs to be closed
\begin{dedication}
    A dedication is optional.
\end{dedication}
```

## v1.4 - 2026-03-18

### Breaking Changes

Added the `\appendices` environment for better handling of appendices. This
both makes it easier to add appendices and fixes numbering and formatting issues.

To update your document, replace:

```diff
- % For an appendix without the chapter numbering, use \section* and add it to 
- % the table of contents manually with \addcontentsline
- \section*{Appendix A: Coffee Survey}
- \addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Appendix A: Coffee Survey}
+ \appendices{
+     \section{Coffee Survey}
```

Then subsections can be added as normal:

```latex
\subsection{Survey Questions}
```

## v1.3 - 2026-03-17

### Breaking Changes

- `fontsetup` has been moved from the document class to the template.
  Add `\usepackage{fontsetup}` to your `.tex` file to use the same fonts as before.

`fontsetup` tends to increase compilation time, so it is now optional. Include
fonts of your choice in the `.tex` file.

## v1.2 - 2026-03-03

Use the `pdfusetitle` option with `hyperref` instead of `hypersetup` for PDF metadata.

To update your document, remove `hypersetup:

```diff
-\AtBeginDocument{
-    \hypersetup{
-        pdftitle={\@title},
-        pdfauthor={\@author}
-    }
-}
```

And add the `pdfusetitle` option to the `hyperref` package:

```diff
-\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}
+\usepackage[hidelinks,pdfusetitle]{hyperref}
```

## v1.1 - 2026-02-26

### Other Changes

These are *not* breaking changes.

- Add notes regarding TeXstudio usage.
- Remove `\subsubsection` from Table of Contents.
- Fix `\subsection` and `\subsubsection` formatting.
- Fix `\itemize` to not use `left-margin`, which isn't available in all environments.

## v1.0 - 2026-02-23

- Initial release.
